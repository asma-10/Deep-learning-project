# Plant Organ Detection using YOLOv8

## Introduction

This project focuses on the detection of non-vegetal elements and plant organs in herbarium specimens using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8). Herbarium specimens are valuable biological resources, serving various studies such as biodiversity, ecology, and evolutionary research. They consist of dried plant specimens mounted on herbarium sheets.

The goal of this project is to propose and train two artificial intelligence models to automatically recognize non-vegetal elements and plant organs in herbarium specimens. This involves adapting and training YOLOv8 for the detection of non-vegetal elements and plant organs.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/2younis/plant-organ-detection). It includes images of herbarium specimens along with corresponding XML annotation files.

### Preprocessing

Before training the models, the images and annotations undergo preprocessing. This involves resizing the images and adjusting the annotations to match the desired input size for the YOLOv8 model.
